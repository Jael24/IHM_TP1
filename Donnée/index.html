<p>The goal of this laboratory is to build Graphical User Interfaces while considering the fundamental principles of design, proposed by Don Norman.
The project can be realised using Qt, Kivy or any library you are familiar with.
<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><font size="+2">A GUI for image annotation</font>
  <p>
Within the context of a Machine Learning project for developing an
  application capable of locating and identifying objects in an image,
  you need to provide a dataset of "labelled" or "annotated"
  images. This means, a collection of images showing where are the
  objects and indicating what they are. Such a database is then used
  to train, for instance an artificial neural network (or any other
  Machine Learning algorithm), which takes advantage of that database
  to offer the capability of locating and identifying the kind of
  objects we labelled (provided that they share some features) in new images.
  <p>
The objective of this laboratory is to develop a GUI that
must allow the user to annotate multiple objects in an image. Suppose
  you have a collection of images to annotate in a given folder.
<p>
The user must be able to select the region of the image containing the object and assign it a label. Multiple objects, hence labels might be present on the image.
<p>
Here are some examples of images to annotate:

<p>
<center>
<img src="images/yolo-object-detection.jpg" height="288" style="float: left; width: 49%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
<img src="images/dog-square.jpg" height="288" style="float: left; width: 49%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
</center>
</p>
<p style="clear: both;">

<p>
<center>
<img src="images/dog-label-cat.png" height="288" style="float: left; width: 49%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
<img src="images/dog-money.png" height="288" style="float: left; width: 49%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
</center>
</p>
<p style="clear: both;">

<p>
You can use the Wang image database that you can download from Cyberlearn to have some images to annotate.
</p>
<p>
The program must be able to generate an output file describing for
  each image the labels that have been annotated and where the item is
  located. 
</p>
Example of possible outputs:
<br/>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>Objects</th>
    <th>Coordinates</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>~/Images/image01.jpg</td>
    <td>[cat, horse]</td>
    <td>[[(2, 2), (2, 50), (100, 2), (100, 50)], [(13, 80), (13, 200), (300, 80), (300, 200)]]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>~/Images/image02.jpg</td>
    <td>[dog]</td>
    <td>[[(27, 24), (27, 77), (155, 24), (155, 77)]]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
This is just an example of a possible format for the output, if you find a better way to display those information, don't hesitate.
</p>

<p>
The GUI must contain:<p>

<li> A menu item allowing to exit the application
<li> A button allowing to select an input image file
<li> A button allowing to select an output file
<li> A text field allowing to edit the name of the output file
<li> A button to add new labels
<li> A way to define the region on the image
<li> A way to attribute a label to the selected region
<li> A way to select multiple regions on the image with different labels
<li> A way to remove a selection in case of error
<li> A way to save what the user has selected on the image
<p>
The GUI must give feedback to the user concerning:<p>
<li> Whether the input file is valid
<li> Whether the output file already exists or not
<li> The region of the image selected by the user for the attribution of the label
<p>
The GUI must fulfill the requirements in the checklist of design
considerations (after Don Norman) presented during the last
lesson. You can modify the type of interface: button, menu, slider,
etc. proposed in the first list if you consider it to be more appropriate.
</p><p><font size="+2">1. Sketch</font>
<p>
Prepare a sketch of your user interface and send it via Cyberlearn
before <b>Tuesday 8th October, before midnight</b><br>
User interface sketching is a kind of drawing on a paper... but it is
not only a simple drawing. Its purpose is to reveal the result of
problem-solving thinking. It communicates the idea to other
people. Drawings do not have to be pretty, but they must help you
validate your idea. Sketches must also reveal the user flow, thus you
may provide multiple pages of drawings illustrating the dynamics of
the interface. Nevertheless, your interface might change during development.

</p><p><font size="+2">2. GUI implementation</font>
<p>
The project can be realised using Qt, Kivy or any library you are
familiar with. In order to guide you towards the implementation of the
GUI, we provide you with two starting guides for <a href="../IHM_Labo1_1/index.html">Qt</a> and <a href="../IHM_Labo1_2/readme.html">Kivy</a>. Qt uses
C++ here, and Kivy is based on Python, which is a language you will be
using a lot next semester.

</p>
</p><p><font size="+2">3. Report</font>
<p>
Please, provide a brief report (max. 4 pages) presenting and accompanying your
GUI. Present the issues tackled by your solution and justify your
choices. Provide your code within a zip file indicating your
names. Demo of your interface: <b>Tuesday 4th November, 2019 before midnight</b>
